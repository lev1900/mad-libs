    <p>Last week, my friend and I decided to take a nice trip to the park.
We were having a great time running through the grass when, quickly, a flock of angry birds swooped down and stole my backpack!
Yikes!, I shouted as the sparkly creatures flew away.
My friend chased after them, determined to get the bag back. He used his giant drone to swat them out of the air. 
When the birds finally gave up and dropped the bag, my friend laughed victoriously.
We counted exactly 50 feathers left on the ground. What a wild day!</p>
